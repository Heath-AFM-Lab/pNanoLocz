Project to develop a Python version of NanoLocz Atomic Force Microscopy Analysis Platform 

This project is in the early stages of development.

# Instructions for activation

We are using a conda environment to run the appplication as it has prospects for future data science and machine learning functionality and good dependancy resolution. Ananconda needs to be installed before running the application. You can find this on the [official Anaconda distribution page](https://www.anaconda.com/download). When running the installer, add anaconda to the PATH variables if on Windows

To initialise conda on the command line, run
```bash
conda init
```

To create the environment, run
```bash
conda create --name pNanoLocz_env python=3.11
```
This will create an environment on your machine that will store all the dependancies required by the program.

To activate the environment, run

On Windows:
```powershell
conda activate pNanoLocz_env
```

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source activate pNanoLocz_env
```

This will switch your PC to the development environment that will now contain the necessary dependancy files. Navigate to the folder containing the file `Requirements.txt`. We will now install these dependancies by running
```bash
python install_requirements.py
```

Once that is completed, we can run the program by running
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

To ensure you are using the latest version of pNanoLocz, regularly update your local repository by running:
```bash
git pull
```
